# Conference Web Site (Hugo Source)

The template is from [SummerTechForumUnconference-hugo](https://github.com/BruceEckel/SummerTechForumUnconference-hugo), Hugo Static Site for the [Summer Tech Forum Conference](https://www.SummerTechForum.com).

The theme supports the site on phones as well as computers and tablets and is from https://github.com/BruceEckel/hugo-material-banner

Everything is in markdown so it's easy to add/edit content. If you look at the
`content` subdirectory and the `config.toml` file you'll see how straightforward it is to add new pages.

## Requirements

- Git
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) `v0.59.0`
- Python (only for `local.bat`)
