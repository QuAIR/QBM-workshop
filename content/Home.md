<font size=7>**Welcome to the International Workshop on Quantum Boltzmann Machines (IW-QBM)**</font>


The International Workshop on Quantum Boltzmann Machines (IW-QBM) is a premier event for researchers, academics, and industry professionals at the forefront of quantum machine learning. This workshop will provide a focused platform for exploring the latest advancements, theoretical breakthroughs, and practical applications of Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs).

**This is an online-only workshop.**

## Dates
**8 - 10 December 2025**

## About the workshop
Quantum Boltzmann Machines represent a leap forward at the intersection of quantum physics and machine learning. By leveraging quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, QBMs offer the potential to solve complex computational problems that are intractable for classical computers. These models are a quantum extension of classical Boltzmann machines, which are fundamental in many machine learning architectures.

The primary objective of this workshop is to foster collaboration and discussion among a diverse group of scientists and engineers. We will delve into the core challenges and opportunities in the field, from developing efficient training algorithms to implementing QBMs on near-term quantum devices.


## Topics of interest
The workshop will cover a broad range of topics related to Quantum Boltzmann Machines, including but not limited to:

- theoretical foundations of QBMs
- training and optimization
- applications of QBMs
- hardware implementation
